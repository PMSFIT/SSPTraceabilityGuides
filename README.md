# SSP Traceability Specification Guides

[![Build Specification](https://github.com/PMSFIT/SSPTraceabilityGuides/actions/workflows/build-guides.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PMSFIT/SSPTraceabilityGuides/actions/workflows/build-guides.yml)

This repository contains additional guides for the current prototyped
draft specification for an [SSP][]-based layered standard for simulation
traceability information exchange.  Note that this specification as
well as the guides in this repository are actively being worked on and
thus subject to change without notice.

The guides are not normative, only the specification itself is
considered normative.

The [workflow guide][workflow] is currently maintained on
[GitHub][githubworkflow] and is published [here][workflow]. It is
based on the [SSP Traceability Specification][spec].

The [specification][spec] is maintained on [GitHub][github] and is
published [here][spec]. It is based on the [SSP 1.0][SSP10] standard.

In future additional guides might be integrated into this repository.
