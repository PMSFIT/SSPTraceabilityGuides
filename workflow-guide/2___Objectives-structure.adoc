== Objectives, structure, and application of SSP traceability

Objectives:

* Structuring of information
* Traceability of simulations and their results
* Reuse of simulations
* Use, exchange in heterogeneous simulation and IT infrastructures
* cooperation with partners

In the following it is described how the STMD Schema supports the Credible Simulation Process. The typical procedure in a development or simulation process is shown in Figure 1.
Many recursions take place in such a process. The Credible Simulation Process (CSP) therefore does not represent the chronological sequence but the logical order of the sequence. This is required for traceability.
The CSP is therefore a documentation schema and not a chronological process description.

Figure 2 shows how the information, the CSP and the coordinated SSP traceability data format Simulation Task Meta Data (STMD) interact. The STMD format is one of the information. Data are linked to the STMD XML schema file according to their type. This STMD XML file with the links can then be saved or exchanged and is the basic building block for traceability.
The LS SSP-Traceability requires that the importing and exporting tools and data management systems support this standard and structure.
However, no specifications are made as to how the internal data management tool must be structured.

The following three layers should be distinguished in implementation and application

* Process
** Structuring of information according to logical context
*	Data
**	Data and version management
* Workflow
**	Interfaces corresponding to the application

The LS SSP-Traceability focuses on supporting the process level. Clear logical structuring as the basis for traceability. The data is linked to the SSP Traceability Schema. Links to any data management system can be used. For exchange with partners who do not have direct access to these systems, this data can be packaged and sent as part of an SSP container. The specifications of this structure are part of the LS SSP-Traceability specification. Users should only enter their information via a workflow interface and use the Credible Simulation Process indirectly. At the workflow interface, the information should be provided in the form and order that corresponds to typical use. Here, a mapping of names that are intuitively understandable for the user in the input masks to the IT systems' unique naming conventions should also take place. These naming conventions are usually not directly intuitive or cumbersome for the user to understand.
The user guide focuses on the application and use of the STMD schema that support the process level.
