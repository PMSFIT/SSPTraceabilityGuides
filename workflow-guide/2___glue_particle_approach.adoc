== The Glue Particle approach

The essential core of the Glue Particle approach is the in-process, machine-readable documentation of information about a credible simulation or modeling task in a standardized  format. 

=== Credibble simulation/modeling process

Both a credible simulation process and a credible modeling process are very similar and both

- have a fixed start in terms of time

- usually start with defined and communicated goals

- are completed at a certain point in time

- are completed upon achievement of the defined goals

- can be structurally divided into execution phases and execution steps.

=== Glue Particle

The task of the Glue Particle is to bundle all relevant information about a credible simulation/modeling process in a standardized format in XML files. This includes, among other things, the inclusion of information about resources used. The inclusion of resources in the Glue Particle may be done in three different ways.

- Resource information may be written directly into the XML file. This procedure is suitable for single or very few atomic information.

- The far more elegant way is to outsource the information into own files and to refer to this outsourced information from the Glue Particle file. This is more suitable for a bigger amount of information.

- A third option is to link the Glue Particle file to relevant resources stored in IT systems.

<<im-threeKindOfResourceInclusion>> illustrates these three ways to include resources.

<<#sec-EmbeddingAndReferencingResources>> goes into more detail about these three options.

A credible simulation/modeling process typically goes through the following execution phases, starting with the analysis of the actual objective of the simulation or modeling task and ending with the decision whether this objective has been met.

- Analysis phase

- Requirements phase

- Design phase

- Implementation phase

- Execution phase

- Evaluation phase

- Fulfillment phase

Therefore, the Glue Particle, which is supposed to document the information about these execution phases, contains seven correspondingly named segments to structure this phase-specific information. In addition, there is a segment with general information about the respective Glue Particle file.

Each execution phase of a credible simulation/modeling process may include one or more execution steps. For example, in the requirements phase,

- Requirements for models,

- Requirements on parameters,

- Requirements to the simulation environment

- Requirements for simulation integration

- Requirements for test cases,

- requirements for quality assurance

may be specified. In addition, a final review of all results of an execution phase and their formal confirmation may be useful. For example, at the end of the requirements phase, there may be a verification of all requirements and their compatibility, as well as the confirmation and release of all requirements. Therefore, in each phase segment there is a final sub-segment that contains information about this verification step. 

Therefore, in a Glue Particle File, each phase segment has one or more step segments for the individual execution steps of an execution phase. Each of these step segments again has the same uniform structure. A segment for a step in a phase is structured according to input, procedure, output, rational and life cycle information. <<in-GlueParticleStructureSchema>> shows the basic structure of a Glue Particle using a section of the STMD XML schema as an example.

It is important to understand what a Glue Particle is and what it is *NOT*, or what it may and *may not* be used for.

What is a "Glue Particle"?

- A Glue Particle is a bundle or compilation of relevant information for a credible simulation/modeling process.

- A Glue Particle is a file used to exchange information between IT tools and systems (data management systems, authoring systems, etc.).

- A Glue Particle is a file used to exchange information between organizations (departments, companies, etc.).

What is a Glue Particle *NOT?*


- A Glue Particle is *NOT* a data format used to organize information in IT systems.

- A Glue Particle is *NOT* a process format for controlling technical or organizational processes.


=== Integration of Glue Particles into the work processes

The Glue Particles may be used both for company-internal documentation to ensure traceability and to support the reusability of information and artifacts as well as for the exchange of information and artifacts across company boundaries. It would be conceivable, for example,

- for a company-internal department to commission another department within a company for a system simulation 

- or to commision an external service provider to create simulation models in order to carry out a simulation task, 

- or to outsource the execution of the actual simulation to an external computing center.

In all these cases, the Glue Particles serve both

- to provide or exchange information and artifacts needed to perform the commissioned task or
- to provide and exchange the documentation on the execution of the task and the documentation of the results.

As an example for a commision, a simulation task may be defined in the context of a component or system development and handed over to a simulation engineer or to a simulation department. As another example, a modelling task may be generated from a simulation task, or to be more specific, from the implementation phase of the simulation task and handed over to a modeling expert. <<im-modelingRequest>> shows schematically how a modeling task is generated from a simulation task and <<im-DataView>> illustrates the role of the Glue Particles in this scenario.

=== Role of Glue Particle in terms of traceabitity

One of the core goals of the Glue Particle approach is the traceability of simulation and modeling processes. This means that it should be retrospectively traceable what was simulated, how it was simulated, which models and which parameters were used for the simulation, which IT tools were used for the simulation and last but not least, which methods were used for the simulation, which assumptions were made and with which rationale these assumptions were made.

All this information is to be bundled in the Glue Particle and with the help of the Glue Particle. The entire simulation or modeling process is covered and the Glue Particle is stored permanently so that it may be consulted at a later point in time if required. The Glue Particle, i.e. the STMD file, is thus the central information carrier for traceability.

=== Role of Glue Particle in terms of credibility

In product and system development projects, numerous design decisions are made based on simulation results. If you want to make  design decisions with certainty, you may have to trust  simulation results. This trust is strongly linked to the credibility of the simulation results and to the credibility of the entire simulation process. A complete high-quality and traceable documentation of the simulation process may significantly and decisively improve the credibility and trust in the simulation process and in the simulation results and thus may ease design decisions.

=== Role of Glue Particle in terms of reusability

In system and product development processes it may be necessary to repeat a simulation. This may be an exact repetition or a repetition with slightly modified boundary conditions. In this case, it is not only important to know what was simulated and how (traceability), but it is also extremely helpful if the resources used can be accessed directly. Here, too, a Glue Particle may play an important role, as it supports the reusability of resources.

=== Integration of the Glue Particle approach into the SSP standard

The SSP Traceability Specification is a so-called layered standard in the sense of the https://ssp-standard.org/[Systems Structure and Parameterization (SSP)] standard of the https://www.modelica.org/[Modelica Association]. In particular, the Glue Particle approach uses the System Structure Package format of SSP. A System Structure Package is a zip archive containing a so-called System Structure Description file (SSD file) and all resources like models and parameter files needed to describe a system structure.

Glue Particles are also packed according to this principle. A Glue Particle for a credibble simulation/modeling process is a zip archive containing at least one SSD file (according to the requirements of the SSP standard) and at least one STMD file. The STMD file represents the actual Glue Particle. If local resources are referenced by the STMD file, they must also be included in the Glue Particle zip archive. When sharing Glue Particles across companies, all external references usually point to files within the zip archive.

<<im-SspSystemStructurePackage>> shows a typical System Structure Package as specified in the SSP standard specification. The SSD file is mandatory. All othre data files are optional according to the business needs. The meaning of the file extensions are 

* The system structure description (SSD) is a mandatory part of every system structure package that is used to describe 
hierarchical and functional structures of a whole FMU network.
* A system structure parameter values (SSV) element is used to describe parameters and external parameter sets that 
can be applied to an FMU, thus parameterizing it. 
* A system structure parameter mapping (SSM) is used to describe parameter mappings that may be required to 
parameterize FMUs.
* A system structure signal dictionary (SSB) is used to describe signals.

All files are encoded in XML.

In order to use the Suytem Structure Package as a standardized container mechanism for carrying Glue Particles along with local file ressources the SSD file must be included in the System Struncture Package archive to remain compatible with the SSP standard. This may be a business compatible SSD file that represents the system being simulated or may also be a "dummy" SSD file that is practically empty with no business related content. The meaning of the file extensions are

* The STMD file is the core file of the Glue Particle.

* The SRMD file is a file that describes simulation resources.

* The SMMD file comprises simulation model medadata, the business related metadata for the Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU).

All files are encoded in XML.
