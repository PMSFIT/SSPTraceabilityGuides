Glue Particle may be used within companies to successively collect information such as inputs, outputs, procedures and their rationales during the simulation process (Credible Simulation Process) for the individual phases and steps of the process and store them in the Glue Particle, thus gradually enriching the Glue Particle.

The Glue Particle is to be carried through the process and the Glue Particle transports information through the IT tool chain. This means that the IT tools and systems used in the simulation process must be able to read or import a Glue Particle and write or export it.

* An IT tool used in phase x of the simulation process would write resources generated by that tool to the Glue Particle or link resources and then export or save the Glue Particle.

* An IT Tool used in phase x-1,x+2 etc. of the simulation process would read or import the Glue Particle and may use the resources provided by it.

This type of IT system coupling via the export - import processes is referred to as asynchronous coupling. The IT systems involved do not have a direct interface with each other and are therefore not directly connected. Therefore, both systems do not have to be in operation at the same time.

<<im-asynchronousCoupling>> illustrates the asynchronous system coupling.

By using the Glue Particle to establish an asynchronous coupling of IT tools and systems involved in the process, the number of interfaces required can be reduced compared to synchronous coupling. This reduction effect increases with the number of IT tools and systems involved in the process and the complexity of the information transport through the process.
