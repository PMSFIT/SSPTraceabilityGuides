=== Versioning mechnisms for Glue Particles

==== Situation

A Glue Particle always represents the processing status at a specific point in time. By viewing an STMD file, it is not possible to determine what the contents of the file looked like at an earlier point in time. A Glue Particle does not store a version history. In order to be able to trace the history of a Glue Particle, several processing statuses of a Glue Particle must be stored separately so that the processing statuses can be viewed in their chronological order.

<<im-versionmechnismsforglueparticle>> shows a typical version history for a Glue Particle in which the individual Glue Particle files have a different fill level.In the first version, only general information and information on the analysis phase is included, while in the subsequent versions the Glue Particle is gradually filled.

The STMD Glue Particle specification lists two different fields for entering a version information at the __SimulationTaskMetaData__ XML element.

.SimulationTaskMetaData element attributes (excerpt)
[width="100%",options="header"]
|===
| Attribute name        | Optional / Mandatory | Atrribute description
| version               | Mandatory            | Version of STMD format, 0.x for this pre-release.
| fileversion           | Optional             | This attribute gives a version number for this file's content.
|===

The attribute __version__ represents the version of the STMD XML schema and is mandatory. The attribute __fileversion__ can be used to provide the Glue Particle with a version. However, it is not suitable for controlling a formal versioning process based on it. On the one hand the attribute is optional and on the other hand it can be edited freely. It is therefore an informal attribute.

Since a Glue Particle does not support an explicit version mechanism according to the specification, technical mechanisms of either the operating system of a computer or a data management system must be used to represent a version history. 

==== Workflow solution

When building a Glue Particle version history supported by a data management system, the editing of a Glue Particle is typically done in conjunction with a check-out/check-in mechanism, where a Glue Particle is locked for editing by other persons or systems after check-out (exclusive check-out). On the one hand, this ensures that there is no inconsistency of information due to parallel processing, and on the other hand, it ensures that a Glue Particle is stored again where it was stored before processing by the check-in. The check-in also ensures that the Glue Particle is saved as a new version of the Glue Particle.

<<im-glueparticleversionhistory>> shows the Glue Particle version history from <<im-versionmechnismsforglueparticle>> as it would appear in a data management system.

<<im-checkoutcheckin>> illustrates how the check-out and check-in mechnism is utilized for editin Glue Particles. As long as a glue Particle version is checked out it is locked for changes by other persons or systems. Whe a Glue Particle version is checked back in  it is unlocked and saved a a new version.

==== Recommendation for working with Glue Particle versions and version histories

The following recommendations for handling glue particle versions and the entire version history of a glue particle are to be understood as basic recommendations. This means that situation-related exceptions would be permissible in principle, as long as transparency is maintained in these exceptional cases.

* In general, only the latest version of a Glue Particle should be edited, as otherwise inconsistencies within the version history may occur, which could make a later retrospective interpretation of the version history more difficult.
* Ideally, it should only be possible to edit the latest version of a glue particle, i.e. it should only be possible to check out the latest version.
